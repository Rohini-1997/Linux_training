Difference between fork(),vfork and excec ?
fork():
  1.Both the child and parent process will have different address space.
  2.Any modification done by the child in its address space is not visible to parent as both will have seperate copies.
  3.This uses copy on write.
  4.Both parent and child execute simultaneously.
  5.Behavior is predictable
  
  
vfork():
 1.Both the child and parent process will have same address space.
 2.Any modification done by the child in its address space visible to parent as both will have same copies.
 3.vfork()doesnot use copy on write.
 4.Parent process will suspend until child execution is completed.
 5.Behavior is not predictable.
